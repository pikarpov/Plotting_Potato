Setup:

	- install Anaconda distribution of Python 3
	  	  (https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda)
	- run 'data1.xlsx' sample file to check everything is working properly
	- run 'data2.xlsx' sample to test fitting routines [includes error bar data]

Description:

	- Utilized for plotting column data from the following formats:
	  (-) .xlsx , .xls (data from first sheet by default)
	  (-) .csv , .txt, .dat (tab, comma, or semicolon delimited)

	- Plotting done as linear, semilog, or log functions
	- Polynamial Fit, providing Chi-Sq, P-value, and StdErr
	- Function Fit via least-square fit routine (initial parameter guess is necessary)

Future Updates:

       - Improve fitting routines
       - Multi-Dimensional Graphs
